To view class diagrams located in this folder you will need
Visual Studio Class Designer installed. If you're using
Visual Studio 2005 Standard and above, it will be included
in standard distribution and you can simply open the diagrams.

Please refer to http://classdesigner for more information/questions
on Class Designer and class diagrams.

Class Designer is not available in Rascal or Visual C# Express.
If you're using one of those you can view the .wmf files exported
from corresponding .cd files and located in the same folder in
a picture viewer.

TODO: Add information on how to install Class Designer for Rascal.
