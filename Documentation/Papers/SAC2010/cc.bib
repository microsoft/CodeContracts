  abstract = {This paper describes the symbolic execution of programs. Instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program (e.g. numbers) one supplies symbols representing arbitrary values. The execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic formulas over the input symbols. The difficult, yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution of conditional branch type statements. A particular system called EFFIGY which provides symbolic execution for program testing and debugging is also described. It interpretively executes programs written in a simple PL/I style programming language. It includes many standard debugging features, the ability to manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions, a simple program testing manager, and a program verifier. A brief discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and program proving is also included. } }

  abstract = { Branch coverage is an important criteria used during the structural testing of programs. In this paper, we present a new program execution based approach to generate input data that exercises a selected branch in a program. The test data generation is initiated with an arbitrarily chosen input from the input domain of the program. A new input is derived from the initial in-put in an attempt to force execution through any of the paths through the selected branch. The method dynamically switches among the paths that reach the branch by refining the input. Using a numerical iterative technique that attempts to generate an input to exercise the branch, it dynamically selects a path that offers less resistance. We have implemented the technique and present experimental results of its performance for some programs. Our results show that our method is feasible and practical. } }
