  abstract =     "This paper describes a semantic basis for a
                 compositional approach to the analysis of logic
                 programs. A logic program is viewed as consisting of a
                 set of modules, each module defining a subset of the
                 program's predicates. Analyses are constructed by
                 considering abstract interpretations of a compositional
                 semantics. The abstract meaning of a module corresponds
                 to its analysis and composition of abstract meanings
                 corresponds to composition of analyses. Such an
                 approach is essential for large program development so
                 that altering one module does not require re-analysis
                 of the entire program. We claim that for a substantial
                 class of programs, compositional analyses which are
                 based on a notion of {\em abstract unfolding\/} provide
                 the same precision as non-compositional analysis. A
                 compositional analysis for ground dependencies is
                 included to illustrate the approach. To the best of our
                 knowledge this is the first account of a compositional
                 framework for the analysis of logic programs.",
