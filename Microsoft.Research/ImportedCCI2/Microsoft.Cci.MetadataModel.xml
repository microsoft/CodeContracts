            True if this reference can be resolved and it resolves to a type alias. The type alias can be retrieved

            A type reference may report this value as false, even though the referenced type definition reports it as true.
            However, any type reference used in a custom attribute must report the correct value for this property or the
            resulting metadata would be invalid.
            Important, do not cache this property. Its value may change from false to true (but not the other way round) in some situations.
            To be on the safe side, resolve all type references whenever possible.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Metadata readers have trouble with this property because an ITypeReference instance is a model for the TypeRef table in the ECMA-335 metadata format.
            Unfortunately, a TypeRef table entry does not distinguish between enum types and other types. The distinction is made in some signatures that
            include TypeRef tokens. A more accurate model of the metadata format would encode the information obtained from those signatures in a separate property of
            the object containing the type reference, or would introduce a new kind of type reference such as INamespaceEnumTypeReference and INestedEnumTypeReference.
            However, for historical/usability reasons this object model oversimplifies the situation by pretending that all type references can tell if they refer to enum types
            or not. When consuming metadata, a type reference starts off with the value being false, but may change it to true as soon as its token is encountered
            in a signature that indicates that it is an enum type. In practice this means that a type reference encountered in a part of the object model where it is
            important to know if the referenced type is an enum type, will get the right value from this property. However, if the value of this property is cached
            as soon as it is encountered for the first time, the wrong value may get cached.

            Value types are sealed and extend System.ValueType or System.Enum.
            A type parameter for which MustBeValueType (the struct constraint in C#) is true also returns true for this property.
            A type reference may report this value as false, even though the referenced type definition reports it as true.
            However, any type reference used in an IL instruction other than ldtoken (used for the C# typeof expression) must report the correct value.
            Important, do not cache this property. Its value may change from false to true (but not the other way round) in some situations.

            This is a somewhat strange property and there is no corresponding bit in the metadata. It serves to
            constrain the way in which metadata is persisted in order to enable a particular implementation technique for
            substituting one type for another at runtime. This bit needs to be set only if there is a need to exploit this
            implementation technique. Metadata readers will set it whenever they encounter a distinct reference (a TypeRef token)
            when the definition (a TypeDef token) could have been used instead. Metadata writers will not substitute
            TypeDef tokens when they persist references with this property set to true.
