            The condition associated with this particular contract element.
            
            For  a loop invariant, the condition that must be true at the start of every iteration of a loop.
            For a precondition, it is the condition that must be true for a caller to call the associated
            method.
            For a postcondition, it is the condition that must be true at the end of the method that is
            associated with this instance.
            For an object invariant, well, it is complicated. In general it is a condition that must be
            true at the end of a public constructor and is both a pre- and postcondition for public methods
            on the type with which the object invariant is associated.
            
            The meaning of the condition is dependent on the type of contract. For instance, mostly this
            will be a boolean-valued expression. But it could also be used for loop variant functions in
            which case this would be an expression which represents a natural number.

            a source string in a source language appropriate for
            the particular tool environment, e.g., when doing static analysis,
            in the language the client code uses, not the language the contract
