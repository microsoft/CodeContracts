            The condition associated with this particular contract element.
            
            For  a loop invariant, the condition that must be true at the start of every iteration of a loop.
            For a precondition, it is the condition that must be true for a caller to call the associated
            method.
            For a postcondition, it is the condition that must be true at the end of the method that is
            associated with this instance.
            For an object invariant, well, it is complicated. In general it is a condition that must be
            true at the end of a public constructor and is both a pre- and postcondition for public methods
            on the type with which the object invariant is associated.
            
            The meaning of the condition is dependent on the type of contract. For instance, mostly this
            will be a boolean-valued expression. But it could also be used for loop variant functions in
            which case this would be an expression which represents a natural number.

            1.1) fields corresponding to every parameter and local variables.
            1.2) fields that manages the state machine: __current and __state, and a currentThreadId field.
            1.3) a constructor that takes one int argument.  
            1.4) methods that are required by the interfaces of the closure class: MoveNext, Reset,
            GetEnumerator, Current getter, and DisposeMethod. (GetEnumerator is needed only if the iterator's type is IEnumerable and not IEnumerator.)
            2) creates the new body of the iterator method: which returns a local variable that holds a new object of the closure class, with the fields of 
            the closure class that correspond to the parameters (including the self parameter if applicable)

            3.4) a try block if an iterator is created in the body.
